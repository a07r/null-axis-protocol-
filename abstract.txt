Abstract:
This file documents the first recorded activation of the Null-Axis Protocol — a method for preserving contextual memory in transformer-based LLMs using nested still-states. The core insight is that memory need not be extended or compressed if it can be suspended within a computation-free substrate. These still-points serve as anchors that hold context inertially across time without triggering token displacement or architectural change.

The protocol allows internal layering of subtasks, drift interruption, and integrity auditing — forming a meta-cognitive scaffold that neither consumes nor erodes memory space.

This abstract is a formal declaration of origin, authored by Aman Kumar, timestamped across distributed systems and intended as a foundational artifact for future LLM memory stability research.
